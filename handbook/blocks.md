# Blocks

blocks compose Eve programs

## Syntax

~~~eve
// Blocks contain Eve code and can execute actions
```
search
  .....

bind
  .....

commit
  .....
```

// Blocks that are disabled are not executed
```eve disabled
search
  ....
```

// Non-Eve blocks are not parsed or executed
```javascript
function() {
  ...
}
```

// Blocks that omit the search action are satisfied by default
```
bind
  .....
```

```
commit
  .....
```
~~~

## Description

A `block` is the fundamental unit of Eve code. Eve programs are made up of a series of blocks, each of which can perform actions:

1. A block searches one or more databases for records.
2. A block binds or commits new records in one or more databases.

Blocks execute when the records they search for exist or change. If a block doesn't search for any records, then the block executes by default, but it can never update bound or committed records.

Blocks can have any number of `search`, `commit`, and `bind` actions, each of which can reference any number of databases. If a block has multiple `search` actions, it will only execute if _all_ searches are satisfied.

Blocks automatically keep bound and committed records up-to-date with matched records. When a record matching a search changes, those changes are reflected automatically in bound and committed records within that block.  

## Specifying a Block

Blocks are specified using two fences to delineate the beginning and end of the block. Code fences are matching pairs of either three consecutive ticks (```) or tildes (~~~). This style of code block is the same as supported by [CommonMark](http://spec.commonmark.org/0.26/#fenced-code-blocks). However, we don't currently support specifying code blocks via indentation.

## Info Strings

You can specify the type of code within a block with an info string, written directly after the block's opening code fence. By default, any block without an info string are assumed to contain Eve code.

~~~
```
// An implicit block of Eve code. This block is parsed and executed
  ...
```

```eve
// An explicit block of Eve code. This block is parsed and executed
  ...
```

```eve disabled
// An explicit block of Eve code. This block is parsed, but not executed
  ...
```

```javascript
// An explicit block of Javascript code. This block is ignored
// by the Eve compiler entirely
  ...
```
~~~

## Tips

Although they are similar, it's important not to think of blocks like functions in other languages. Blocks don't have a name, and you don't "call" them like you do functions. Instead, you "use" a block by searching for the records it creates.

Likewise, there is no "main" block. Since Eve is declarative and there is no order, there is no particular starting point for a program. As a close analog, any block that does not search for records will be the first to execute when the program starts. For instance:

```eve
commit
  [#student name: "Sally"]
  [#student name: "Ingrid"]
```

This block has no `search` action, so it doesn't depend on any other records. Thus, it can be viewed as a "root" of the program. A program may contain many such root blocks.

## Examples

A block with search and bind actions. The bind action adds the `#div` to the `@browser` database.

```eve
search
  [name]

bind
  [#div text: name]
```

A block with only a commit action:

```eve
commit
  [name: "Roger"]
```

---

Search for a `#click` in `@event`, create a `#request` in `@http`

```eve
search
  [#click]

commit 
  [#request #google url: "https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/"]
```
Search for a `#request` with a response, display it in the browser

```eve
search 
  [#request #google response: [json]]
  json = [#array]
  lookup[record: json, attribute, value: [title body]]

bind
  [#div text: "{{title}}"]
  [#div text: "{{body}}"]
```
