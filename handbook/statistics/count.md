# count

Returns the number of elements in a set

## Syntax

```eve
// Counts the elements in given
y = count[given]

// Counts the elements established by the set (var1, ... , varN)
y = count[given: (var1, ... , varN)]

// Group given by the values in per, and count each group
y = count[given, per]
```

## Attributes

- `given` - establishes the set to count over.
- `per` - _optional_ - one or more attributes by which to group `given`.

## Description

`y = count[given]` counts the number of elements in `given`.

`y = count[given: ()]` counts the number of elements in `given`.

`y = count[given, per]` counts the number of elements in `given`, grouped by the attribute(s) provided in `per`. For instance, `class-size = count[given: students, per: grade]` would count the number of students in each grade. You can group along multiple axes; the previous example could be extended to work across multiple schools by doing `class-size = count[given: students, per: (grade, school)]`. See the examples section to see these in action.

## Counting Zero

Eve's semantics prevent count from ever returning 0; For `count[]` to run, a search must match at least one record. If a search doesn't match any records, then the entire block will not execute. In order to actually get a 0 result, you have to condition the count with an if expression:

```eve
search
	total-items = if c = count[given: [#item]] then c
                else 0
bind @view
	[#value | value: "total items: {{total-items}}"]
```

This block searches for `[#item]` records. If any are found, then `count[]` is able to proceed. If none are found, then the if expression allows the block to execute nonetheless, so the total items is correctly reported as 0.

## Examples

Before we get to the `count[]` examples, let's add some students. Each `#student` has a `grade` and a `school`. Grades are one of 10, 11, or 12. Schools are one of "West" and "East".

```eve
commit
  [#student name: "Diedra" grade: 10 school: "West"]
  [#student name: "Celia" grade: 10 school: "West"]
  [#student name: "Michaela" grade: 11 school: "West"]
  [#student name: "Jermaine" grade: 11 school: "West"]
  [#student name: "Issac" grade: 12 school: "West"]
  [#student name: "Jamar" grade: 12 school: "West"]
  [#student name: "Yee" grade: 10 school: "East"]
  [#student name: "Johanne" grade: 10 school: "East"]
  [#student name: "Mertie" grade: 10 school: "East"]
  [#student name: "Elmira" grade: 11 school: "East"]
```

First let's count the total number of students in the school district.

```eve
search
  students = [#student]
  enrollment = count[given: students]

bind
  [#view/value | value: "There are {{enrollment}} students in the district"]
```

Now let's count the number of students in each school.

```eve
search
  students = [#student school]
  school-enrollment = count[given: students, per: school]

bind
  [#view/value | value: "{{school-enrollment}} attend {{school}}"]
```

We could have similarly counted the number of students in each grade across the district.

```eve
search
  students = [#student grade]
  grade-enrollment = count[given: students, per: grade]

bind
  [#view/value | value: "{{grade-enrollment}} students are in {{grade}}th grade"]
```

Finally, we can count the number of students per grade, per school. 

```eve
search
  students = [#student grade school]
  grade-school-enrollment = count[given: students, per: (grade, school)]

bind
  [#view/value | value: "{{grade-school-enrollment}} students are in {{grade}}th grade at {{school}}"]
```
